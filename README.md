# Access-Control-System
A Smart way of locking and unlocking the doors without much effort by humans. This Access Control System is using the technologies like RFID. Many major companies like L&amp;T Metro service and FasTag has been relying on this technology.
This technology uses a Unique Identification code for each tag and lets the people pass through.
In this project, we will be demonstrating the exact working of the RFID technology in conjunction with the use of a Database for data storage.
Once the RFID Scanner scans the tag or the card it will detect the unique identification code and then validate the code with the codes in the database and will inscribe the date and time of the entry of each identification code. 
So as the Unique Identification code is valid then the person can go through the gates/door. Any non-valid entries will be denied at the entrance itself.
The same work will be carried out in the Metro and FasTag services which enables the user to pass through the gates easily by using the tags which every tag has its code.
